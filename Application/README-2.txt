*RESEARCH PROPOSAL:		PROSPECT
*Requestor: 			Stephanie Wu (Harvard Chan)
*Proposed Title1: 		Representative dietary behavior archetypes and risk of cardiometabolic outcomes among Puerto Ricans using a 					Bayesian latent class analysis for non-probability samples

*Research Hypotheses:		
				1. To extend recently developed Bayesian weighted latent class analysis models to a non-probability sample 					setting, ensuring accurate point and variance estimation through extensive simulation studies. 
				2. To derive archetypal clusters that describe key dietary behavior patterns among Puerto Rican adults.
				3. To examine how these dietary behavior archetypes relate to hypertension, type 2 diabetes, and high 						cholesterol.

*Prepared by: 			Elizabeth Petit;
*Dataset: 			PROSPECT General Questionnaire
*Data accessed from REDCap: 	8/27/2024;
				9/5/2024;
				9/16/2024;
				9/18/2024;

*Notes: 			Inclusions: All PROSPECT participants that have data for the dietary behavior, hypertension, type 2 diabetes, 					high cholesterol, and socio-demographic variables listed below will be included.
				Exclusions: 
				missing dietary behavior or attitudes (DBHIV) (n=X); 
				missing cardiometabolic conditions (T2D, high cholesterol, hypertension) (n=X). 
				missing age, sex, ethnicity, rural residency, education, income, tobacco, physical activity, food security, 					WIC/SNAP use, social support scale, perceived stress, depression, or generalized anxiety (n=X)

1.) Exclusions:  Exclusions made only for unreliable interviews:

N breakdown:
Prospect records to date:	n=1732 (Baseline) 
Unreliable interviews: 		n=32
Preliminary dataset:		n=1700 

2.) Inclusion: The Preliminary dataset includes all participants with "reliable" status for interviews.
  
3.) Missingness: If there are data missing, the question was either not answered or the participant Refused, Does not remember, or Does not know (set to missing).

4.) 5.) Outliers: Lab values were not adjusted for outliers.  I sent you the raw data so that you can make those determinations.
